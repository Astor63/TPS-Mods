Is that the Moxxi's weapons skins in TPS? ... seriously? ... but not ever 2 skins are the same!?!

That doesn't make sense to me... and it's just not prettier!

Where is gone the Orange/Red Fire color from the original BL2 *Creamer/Heart Breaker* vanilla skin ???

I decided to totally restore the BL2 Classic Moxxi Skin...

I change the vanilla color to the BL2 Classic Orange/Red Fire color, colorize the metal part, adapt the Moxxi logo in a more appropriate size when necessary... and repeat the same work on all the Moxxi weapons.

Now, with the *Moxxi Signature Classic Collection*, there are all uniform to look like an actual manufacturer.

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make weapon skin... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
