Is that the Moxxi's weapons skins in TPS? ... seriously? ... but not ever 2 skins are the same!?!

Argh! It's not pretty at all... Let's fix that!

First, I take the red color similar to the little *Cartier* box, next I made the metal part looking like (silver) steel... add some discrete decorative gold parts like the golden screws inserted into a brushed steel bracelet... finally adapt the Moxxi logo in a more appropriate size when necessary... and repeat the same work on all the Moxxi weapons...

Et Voila! Here is the *TPS - Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection*... and now the Moxxi's weapons are all uniform and look like an actual manufacturer.

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### To do:

### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make weapon skin... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
