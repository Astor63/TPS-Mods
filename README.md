## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

You are on TPS-Mods repository, where you can find all my TPS Mods. (For the BL2 Mods, please go to the BL2-Mods section) 

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## [Work in progress] [TPS - Double Quest Reward v1.0.0]

 - This Mod will give you the choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a Unique weapon/item with desired parts, and will upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to a Blue weapon/item rewards.

 
 Will be released soon
