  - ***Recruitement Drive*** in Triton Flats - Time limit increased to 9:00 (instead of 4:30)
  - ***The Don*** in Vorago Solitude - Time limit increased to 6:00 (instead of 4:30)

- **Option #2: *No time limit***
  - ***Pop Racing*** in Triton Flats - Time limit increased to 3:00 (instead of 1:30)

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Quest Fix](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Quest%20Changes/QuestFix.txt) created for BL2 by [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell). I just adapted his idea to the few timed optional mission from TPS. All the credits go to him for the idea.
