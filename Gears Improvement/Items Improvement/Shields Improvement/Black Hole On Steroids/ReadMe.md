## *Black Hole* On Steroids

To be competitive with the Maliwan's shield *Supernova*, the singularity ability from the *Black Hole* is boosted to make better use of ~~sucking~~ pulling nearby enemies towards the wearer when the shield charge is depleted, then explodes in a devastating nova shock.

The others improvements are a *Capacity* twice smaller, coupled with a *Recharge Rate* twice faster and *Recharge Delay* 3.5x faster (to get more often shock nova release) makes the *Black Hole* really... I want to say "shocking", but it would be a bad pun for shock nova shield... so let say destructive! 

| Black Hole (lvl 50) | Vanilla Version  | On Steroids Version | Change         | 
| -------------       | -------------    | -------------       | -------------  |                             
| Capacity:           | 12552            | 5924                | (2x Smaller)   | 
| Recharge Rate:      | 1491             | 3031                | (2x Faster)    | 
| Recharge Delay:     | 4,20             | 1,21                | (3.5x Faster)  | 
| Nova Damage:        | 19722            | 24652               | (22% Stronger) | 
| Nova Radius:        | 520              | 800                 | (15% Bigger)   | 

The *Nova Damage* and *Nova Radius* were slighty improved too, but not that much, respectively 22% & 15%.

__Note:__ With the improvement done, the singularity effect from the *Black Hole* is very useful for drawing in enemies for a second wind, and can often kill common enemies in a single blast.

Now, the *Black Hole* can (really) be used to break enemy attack patterns, drag enemies out of cover (with the singularity effect) and wipe them out with a combination of shock nova and gunfire before they recover completely from the stun effect, making it a viable offensive shield as well.

### Where to find it?

The *Black Hole* can be obtained randomly from any suitable loot source but has an increased chance to drop from *Colonel Zarpedon* in *Eye of Helios* and *The Invincible Empyrean Sentinel* in *Eleseer*.

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, November 15, 2018
  - Initial public release.
- v1.0.1, November 20, 2018
  - Fix the issue from a part of the improvement done to the *Black Hole* applying to the *Supernova* by making a *Supernova Missing Material Fix* (available in *Fixes* folder).
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with the latest version of [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Legendary Nova Shield (see *know issue* just below).
- ~~**Know issue:** I noticed that a part (mainly the low capacity coupled with the quick recharge effect) of the improvement done at the Black Hole apply to another Maliwan Legendary Shield, the Supernova and -unintentionally!- makes it even better... so I won't try to fix it.~~  __Solved by making a *Supernova Missing Material Fix*__ (available in *Fixes*)

### To do:

- [x] Fix the *Supernova* issue.
- [ ] Well... it seems to work correctly, so nothing I guess?

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Gear Overhaul 1.36](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon/Gear%20Overhaul%201.36.txt) created for BL2 by [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create some gears improvements (one by one). All the credits go to [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon) for the idea.
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
