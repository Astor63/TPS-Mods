### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### To do:

- [ ] Well... it seems to work correctly, so nothing I guess?

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Gear Overhaul 1.36](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon/Gear%20Overhaul%201.36.txt) created for BL2 by [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create some gears improvements (one by one). All the credits go to [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon) for the idea.
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
