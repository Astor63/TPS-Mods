## *Black Hole* & *SuperNova* On Steroids

Since my mod *SuperNova*'s Missing Material Fix share the Black Hole's *Unique (predefined) Material* for these both shields, this Mod includes the *Black Hole* and *SuperNova*... and my stand-alone fix *Supernova Missing Material Fix* because it's mandatory to make this Mod working correctly.

### *Black Hole* On Steroids

To make it more competitive with the others shields, the singularity ability from the *Black Hole* is boosted to make better use of ~~sucking~~ pulling nearby enemies towards the wearer when the shield charge is depleted, then explodes in a devastating nova shock.

The others improvements are a *Capacity* twice smaller, coupled with a *Recharge Rate* twice faster and *Recharge Delay* 3.5x faster (to get more often shock nova release) makes the *Black Hole* really... I want to say "shocking", but it would be a bad pun for shock nova shield... so let say destructive! 

| Black Hole (lvl 50) | Vanilla Version  | On Steroids Version | Change         | 
| -------------       | -------------    | -------------       | -------------  |                             
| Capacity:           | 12552            | 5924                | (2x Smaller)   | 
| Recharge Rate:      | 1491             | 3031                | (2x Faster)    | 
| Recharge Delay:     | 4,20             | 1,21                | (3.5x Faster)  | 
| Nova Damage:        | 19722            | 24652               | (22% Stronger) | 
| Nova Radius:        | 520              | 800                 | (15% Bigger)   | 

The *Nova Damage* and *Nova Radius* were slighty improved too, but not that much, respectively 22% & 15%.

__Note:__ With the improvement done, the singularity effect from the *Black Hole* is very useful for drawing in enemies for a second wind, and can often kill common enemies in a single blast.

Now, the *Black Hole* can (really) be used to break enemy attack patterns, drag enemies out of cover (with the singularity effect) and wipe them out with a combination of shock nova and gunfire before they recover completely from the stun effect, making it a viable offensive shield as well.

### Where to find it?

The *Black Hole* can be obtained randomly from any suitable loot source but has an increased chance to drop from *Colonel Zarpedon* in *Eye of Helios* and *The Invincible Empyrean Sentinel* in *Eleseer*.

### *SuperNova* On Steroids

A lowered capacity coupled with a faster recharge makes the SuperNova really devastating when exploding (more often) in a huge and powerful Incendiary Nova blast.

The major improvements are a *Capacity* twice smaller, coupled with a *Recharge Rate* twice faster and *Recharge Delay* 3.5x faster (to get incendiary nova release more often) makes the *SuperNova* really... I want to say "arousing", but it would be a bad pun for incendiary nova shield... so let say to cause more troubles to your ennemy!

| SuperNova lvl 50    | Vanilla Version  | Version On Steroids | Change         | 
| -------------       | -------------    | -------------       | -------------  |                             
| Capacity:           | 10242            | 4785                | (2x Smaller)   | 
| Recharge Rate:      | 1750             | 3584                | (2x Faster)    | 
| Recharge Delay:     | 4,06             | 1,17                | (3.5x Faster)  | 
| Nova Damage:        | 20285            | 25760               | (25% Stronger) | 
| Nova Radius:        | 2056             | 3080                | (50% Bigger)   | 

To get better result in ~~vacum~~... ~~vaacum~~... ~~vaccuum~~... Arrrrgh!... in space, the *Nova Damage* and *Nova Radius* were improved too, respectively 20% & 50%; because, you know... no oxygene, no fire!

### Where to find it?

The *SuperNova* has an increased chance to drop from *Bruce* (a Badass Outlaw) during the mission *Another Pickle* in *Crisis Scar*, or from *Maureen* (Deirdre's psycho twin sister), driving a Missile Moon Buggy during the mission *Wherefore Art Thou?* in *Triton Flats*.

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, November 25, 2018
  - Initial public release.
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with the latest version of [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch to the *Black Hole* and/or *SuperNova* Properties.
 
:warning: This Mod is compatible with my *Supernova Missing Material Fix*, but must be placed __AFTER__ *Supernova Missing Material Fix*. :warning:

### To do:

- [ ] Fix the SuperNova skin which still mix few parts from the Random Material bug.
- [ ] Well... it seems to work correctly, so nothing I guess?

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Gear Overhaul 1.36](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon/Gear%20Overhaul%201.36.txt) created for BL2 by [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create some gears improvements (one by one). All the credits go to [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon) for the idea.
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
