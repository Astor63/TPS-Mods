## *Moonscaper* with Grenade Damage

Replaces the *Rocket Damage* by *Grenade Damage*, on this way the damage can be increased by Character Skill (like Claptrap's "Grenade Vent" in Fragmented Fragtrap skill)
 
### Where to find it?

Initially, the *Moonscaper* is a exclusive reward for buying the *Tales from the Borderlands Season Pass* and can be obtained from the *Shift Vending Machine* in Concordia, but UCP 2.2 rewards it for the mission *BoomShakalaka* in *Outlands Canyon*.

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, January 01, 2019
  - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with the latest version of [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:
