## *Omni-Cannon* with Grenade Damage

While TPS Patch 2.2 upgrades to the *Omni-Cannon* have made it a MUCH more valuable piece, it still does not become viable enough for most characters; but with this Grenade Damage Bonus added, the *Omni-Cannon* will become one of the BEST sniper rifle in TPS.
 
### Where to find it?

The *Omni-Cannon* can be obtained randomly from any suitable loot source and has an increased chance to drop from *The Sponx* located in *The Temple of Boom* (during *Claptastic Voyage* DLC).
