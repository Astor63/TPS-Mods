## *KerBoom* with Singularity Grenade

Turns the *KerBoom* into a useful weapon:

- Shot 1 rockets, which spawn 1 singularity child grenade.
- No self-damage on the rocket and the grenade.
- Cuts the cost of ammo to 2 per shot (instead of 4) and effectively doubles the magazine.
 
### Where to find it?

The *KerBoom* can be obtained randomly from any suitable loot source, and has an increased chance to drop from *Boomer* encountered in the south-east corner of *Outlands Spur* during the mission *Nothing Is Never an Option*. 

### Changelog:
