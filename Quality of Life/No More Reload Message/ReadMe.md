## No More Reload Message

As the title suggests it, removes the *Reload Message* which pop-up (too) often on the screen!

**Note:** Just removes the *Reload Message*, **NOT** the necessity to reload your weapon

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, November 6, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)

### To do:

- [ ] Check if I don't forget a Unique weapons somewhere in the game (maybe in DLC?).
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ smart notes.

### Credits & Thanks:

Without the great [Dave'S BL2 Skin Modding Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/BLCM/BLCMods/bb1933f7/Borderlands%202%20mods/Dave/DAVE%27S%20BL2%20SKIN%20MODDING%20GUIDE.pdf) ... I won't be able to make any skin, so thanks for your great work, @DaveRabbit
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make weapon skin... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
