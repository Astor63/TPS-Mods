## Throw Grenades in FFYL

Similar to Axton's Gunpowder Skill *Do or Die* in BL2, you can now throw grenades when you are in *Fight For Your Life*, and with any character!

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, November 8, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)

### To do:

- [ ] Well... it seems to work correctly, so nothing I guess?

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Throw Grenade in FFYL](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/AngrierPat/Quality%20of%20life%20changes/Throw%20Grenades%20in%20FFYL) created for BL2 by [AngrierPat](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/AngrierPat). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create one. All the credits go to [AngrierPat](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/AngrierPat) for the idea. 
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
