## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

You are on TPS-Mods repository, where you can find all my Pre-Sequel (AKA Borderlands-The Pre-Sequel) Mods. (For the BL2 Mods, please go to the BL2-Mods section) 

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

* * * * *

## To Read First: 

- __Compatibility & Troubleshooting:__ a small reading information to clearly understand why a option or a fix in my mods don't work as intended, and how to simply fix it!

* * * * *

## Characters Change:

- ### All Characters:

  - __Throw Grenade in FFYL:__ Now you can throw grenades while in FFYL, with any character.

- ### Aurelia 
  - __*Cold As Ice* in FFYL:__ You can throw your *Frost Diadem Shard* (*Cold As Ice* ability) while in *Fight For Your Live*.

- ### Jack:
  - __*DigiJack* in FFYL:__ You can summon your *DigiJack* to fight alongside you while in *Fight For Your Live*.

* * * * *

## Custom Gears:

- ### Custom Items:

  - ### Custom Shield:

   - __*Black Hole* & *SuperNova* On Steroids:__ Since my *SuperNova*'s Missing Material Fix share the Black Hole's *Unique (predefined) Material* for these both shields, this Mod includes the *Black Hole* and *SuperNova*... and my stand-alone fix *Supernova Missing Material Fix* because it's mandatory to make this Mod working correctly.

- ### Custom Weapons:

  - ### Custom Shotgun:
  
    - __*Striker* Real Fandir Edition:__ Always fires thirteen pellets (Fandir? Thirteen), but deals significantly less damage per pellet. 

* * * * *

## Gears Fixes:

- __*Deadly Bloom* Legendary Fix:__ Fix the *Deadly Bloom* Legendary bug by makes it regain his *legit* Legendary rarity, value & skin.

- __*SuperNova* Missing Material Fix:__ My modest contribution to fix the *Missing Material* bug which makes the *SuperNova* spawn with four different materials rather than just the predefined one and affecting the shield capacity, nova damage, and nova radius.

## UCP 2.2 Fixes:

- __Buff *Volcano* Fix:__ Fix the faulty line of code in *TPS Patch 2.2.* to make the +50% Radius Damage (280 instead of 190) applying correctly.

* * * * *

## Gears Improvement:
     
- ### Items Improvement:
  
  - #### Shields Improvement:
    
    - __*Booster Shields* Auto Pick-Up:__ Automatically pick-up, however, to balance the auto pick-up advantage, the restoration value is reduced from Â±20%.

- ### Weapons Improvement:

  - ### Assault Rifle Improvement:

    - __*KerBoom* with Singularity Grenade:__ Turns the KerBoom into a useful weapon by shooting 1 rockets, which spawn 1 singularity child grenade.

- ### Sniper Rifle Improvement:

  - ***Omni-Cannon* with Grenade Damage:** with this *Grenade Damage Bonus* added, the *Omni-Cannon* will become one of the BEST sniper rifle in TPS.

* * * * *

## Quality of Life: 

- __More Pick-Up Radius:__ It's a all simple Mod but somewhat large, in a sense, change!

- __No More Reload Message:__ Removes the (annoying) *Reload Message* which pop-up (too) often on the screen!

* * * * *

## Quest Change:

- __Less Tedious Quests:__ Makes a few timed __-*failable!*-__ optional mission less tedious to complete.

* * * * *
 
## Skin Pack:

- __Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection:__ The red similar to the little *Cartier* box, with discrete golden part inserted into (silver) brushed steel, this is the French elegance.
