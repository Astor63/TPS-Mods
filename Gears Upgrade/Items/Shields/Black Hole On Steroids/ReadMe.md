## *Black Hole* On Steroids

To be competitive with the Maliwan's shield *Supernova*, the singularity ability is boosted to make better use of pulling nearby enemies towards the wearer when the shield charge is depleted, then explodes in a huge devastating nova shock.

Now, the singularity effect is very useful for drawing in enemies for a second wind, and can often kill common enemies in a single blast.

It can also be used to break enemy attack patterns, drag enemies out of cover and wipe them out with a combination of nova and gunfire before they recover completely from the stun effect, making it a viable offensive shield as well.

### Where to find it?

The *Black Hole* can be obtained randomly from any suitable loot source but has an increased chance to drop from *Colonel Zarpedon* in *Eye of Helios* and *The Invincible Empyrean Sentinel* in *Eleseer*. 

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, November 15, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with the latest version of [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)

- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Legendary Nova Shield (see *know issue* just below).

- **Know issue:** I noticed that a part (mainly the low capaticity coupled with the quick recharge effect) of the improvement done at the *Black Hole* apply to another Maliwan Legendary Shield, the *Supernova* and -unintentionally!- makes it even better... so I won't try to fix it.

### To do:

- [ ] Well... it seems to work correctly, so nothing I guess?
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
