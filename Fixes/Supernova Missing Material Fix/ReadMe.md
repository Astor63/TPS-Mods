## *SuperNova* Missing Material Fix

The Missing Material bug (and its consequences), as explained on __[Borderlands Wiki - Supernova](https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Supernova)__ page:

> Due to a coding bug, it is possible for the *Supernova* to spawn with four different materials rather than just the predefined one. Normally, a Legendary shield has a predefined material, either custom or the standard Epic rarity material. __The material difference affects the shield capacity, nova damage, and nova radius, even when all other parts are the same.__
>
>- __Common__ (Same skin as *white rarity* Maliwan shields)
>- __Uncommon__ (Same as *green rarity* Maliwan shields)
>- __Rare__ (Same as *blue rarity* Maliwan shields)
>- __Epic__ (Same as *purple rarity* Maliwan shields) 
>
> When the *Supernova* spawns with the Uncommon (Green) skin, its rarity colour will be Magenta, although it is still sorted in the inventory as if it were a Legendary shield. The Magenta rarity version does not actually have different properties than the other versions of the shield, apart from the usual Material Grade bonuses.

To explain the *Missing Material* bug in a simple way, when a Legendary or Unique shield spawn, it has his own predefined material... for example:

__*Sunshine*__ - Unique Maliwan Rare (Blue) Nova shield 
 
```ItemPartListDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.PartsList_Materials_Nova_Sunshine'```

__*Deadly Bloom*__ - Unique Maliwan Epic (Purple) Nova shield
 
```ItemPartListDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.PartsList_Materials_Nova_DeadlyBloom'```

__*Black Hole*__ - Legendary Maliwan Nova shield
 
```ItemPartListDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.PartsList_Materials_Nova_Singularity'```

__*SuperNova*__ - Legendary Maliwan Nova shield... instead to have his own predefined material (like above), it has the following:

```MaterialParts=ItemPartListDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.PartsList_Materials_NovaSpike_Maliwan'```

...which include four different materials: 

```ShieldPartDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.Material1_Common_NovaSpike_Maliwan'```
```ShieldPartDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.Material2_Uncommon_NovaSpike_Maliwan'```
```ShieldPartDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.Material3_Rare_NovaSpike_Maliwan'```
```ShieldPartDefinition'GD_Shields.Material.Material4_VeryRare_NovaSpike_Maliwan'```

... and that's the reason why the *SuperNova* can spawn with four random different materials affecting the shield capacity, Nova damage, and Nova radius.

Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare (and understand) how the *Random Material Grade Bonuses* differences affect the *SuperNova* capacity (Capacity), Nova damage (Special 01), and Nova radius (Special 02) in a table:

| -Material Grade Bonuses- | Capacity      | Special 01 (Nova Damage) | Special 02 (Nova Radius) |
| -------------            | ------------- | -------------            |-------------             |
| Common (White)           | N/A           | N/A                      | N/A                      |
| Uncommon (Green)         | 4             | 6                        | 6                        |
| Rare (Blue)              | 8             | 12                       | 12                       |
| Epic (Purple)            | 12            | 18                       | 18                       |

### My modest contribution to fix this (naughty) bug:

If I modify any properties from the actual Material (Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic) wich actually spawn with the *SuperNova*, this will modify all the Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic Maliwan Spike Shield and the Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic Maliwan Nova Shield... so the only way to solve this *Missing Material* bug, it's to borrow a *Unique (predefined) Material* to another Legendary shield.

### Step 1: Missing Material Fix

To keep the thing simple, as the *SuperNova* is a Legendary Maliwan shield, I will borrow the Missing Material from the *Black Hole* which is another Legendary Maliwan shield, and make the *SuperNova* always spawn with this *Unique (predefined) Material*.

So yes, now, the *Black Hole* and the *SuperNova* share the same Unique Material, which mean that any modification made to this Unique Material will apply on both shields... and obviously that *-unfortunately!-* the *Black Hole* Unique Material already modifies the *SuperNova* Properties.

### Step 2: Unique Properties Fix

Yep! Ironically, I solve a problem by creating another one, but now as the *SuperNova* has Unique Properties, it can be solved easily.

Since the *SuperNova* share the ```GD_Shields.Material.PartsList_Materials_Nova_Singularity``` from the *Black Hole*, the *Material Grade Bonuses* from the *Black Hole* applies the *SuperNova*, and of course, they are different... very different:

| -Material Grade Bonuses- | Capacity      | Special 01 (Nova Damage) | Special 02 (Nova Radius) | 
| -------------            | ------------- | -------------            |-------------             |
| Black Hole               | 16            | 30                       | 0                        |
| SuperNova (Epic)         | 12            | 18                       | 18                       |

To resorb these differences caused by the new shared *Black Hole's Unique Material*, I manuallly edit the properties from the *SuperNova* to get them back as close as possible to the best Material available previously, which was the Epic (purple) Material... and here's the result from this tweak:

| SuperNova lvl 50    | Vanilla Epic (purple) Material | With Shared Black Hole Material    |  
| -------------       | -------------                  | -------------       |                              
| Capacity:           | 10242                          | 10310               |  
| Recharge Rate:      | 1750                           | 1751                |  
| Recharge Delay:     | 4,06                           | 4,01                |  
| Nova Damage:        | 20285                          | 21007               |  
| Nova Radius:        | 2056                           | 2052                | 

### Step 3: Legendary Skin Fix

As the *Supernova* use now a the Black Hole's *Unique (predefined) Material*, it will have a Legendary skin instead of a random Epic/Rare/Common/Uncommon skin. 

### Step 4: Legendary Value fix:

As the Monetary value, is linked to the Black Hole's *Unique (predefined) Material* used, the random Epic/Rare/Common/Uncommon Monetary Value is upgraded to Legendary Monetary Value.

### Step 4: Legendary Shield Lootpool:

At least, no change needed to be done to the lootpool, as the *SuperNova* is already in the (correct) Legendary pool.

__Note:__ The *SuperNova* can be randomly obtained in the grinder by grinding three Legendary shields (like any other Legendary shield)
