## *Striker* Real Fandir Edition

A picture worth 1.000 words, so let's start with a picture...

- Always fires thirteen pellets (Fandir? Thirteen), but deals significantly less damage per pellet.
- The spread becomes slighty tighter to help its functionality as a Crit shotgun.
- As he won't gain pellets from the Vertical Grip accessory, he will never spawn with it.

The *Striker Real Fandir Edition* becomes an excellent weapon for *Nisha's Showdown skill* as the pellet spread is so precise that usually each do critical damage.

__Note:__ With both the *Doc's Prefix* and the *Punisher Luneshine* it's possible to obtain a +138% percent critical bonus on a *Striker Real Fandir Edition*... not bad for a 13 pellet shotgun! 
 
### Where to find it?

The *Striker* can be obtained randomly from any suitable loot source but has an increased chance to drop from *Red Belly* in *Crisis Scar*.
