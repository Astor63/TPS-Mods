This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

* * * * *

## To Read First: 

- __Compatibility & Troubleshooting:__ a small reading information to clearly understand why a option or a fix in my mods don't work as intended, and how to simply fix it!

* * * * *

## Characters Change:

- ### All Characters:

- ### Aurelia:

- ### Jack:

- ### Nisha:

  - __*Showdown in FFYL:*__ Now you can use *Showdown* (Nisha's ability) while in *Fight For Your Life*.

- ### Wilhem: 
 
  - __*Wolf & Saint in FFYL:*__ You can summon *Wolf* (red combat drone) and/or *Saint* (white support drone) to fight alongside you while in *Fight For Your Live*.

* * * * *

## Fixes:

  - __*No* Fix:__ for now.

* * * * *

## Gears Upgrade:

- ### Weapons:

  - #### Assault Rifle: 

  - #### Shotgun:

     - __*Striker* Fandir Edition:__ Deals significantly less damage per pellet and fires thirteen pellets (Fandir? Thirteen).
     
     - __*Wombat* No Self-Damage:__ This Torgue shotgun becomes viable for *second wind* as you will not automatically go down again from the self-damage.

  - #### Sniper Rifle:

     - __*Omni-Cannon* with Grenade Damage:__ With this *Grenade Damage Bonus* added, the *Omni-Cannon* will become one of the BEST sniper rifle in TPS.
      
- ### Items:
  
   - #### Grenades:

      - __*Kiss Of Death* Enhanced:__ Double the grenade damages and triple the fuse time.
 
   - #### Shields:
 
      - __*Moxxi's Slammer* "Drink" Auto Pick-Up:__ Automatically pick-up simply by walking on it.

      - __*Whiskey Tango Foxtrot* Improvement:__ Double the *IED (Improvised Explosive Device) boosters* dropped to increase the *Whiskey Tango Foxtrot* offensive capability.


## Quality of Life 

- __*More Pick-Up Radius:*__ It's a all simple Mod but somewhat large, in a sense, change!

- __*No More Teleporter Voyage:*__ As you already guess, this Mod disables the useless (and annoying) teleporter voyage animation!

## Quest Rewards:

-  __*Double Quest Rewards:*__ Give you the choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a Unique weapon/item with desired element/part/accessory.
