## No More Reload Message

As the title suggests it, removes the (annoying) *Reload Message* which pop-up (too) often on the screen!

**Note:** Just removes the *Reload Message*, **NOT** the necessity to reload your weapon!

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, November 6, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with the latest version of [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)

### To do:

- [ ] Check if I don't forget a Unique weapons somewhere in the game (maybe in DLC?).

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Fuck Reload Messages](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/af3b2d17629ab3f7f7a5f7bb68b489c5e13b0498/Borderlands%202%20mods/soze/fuckreloadmessages.txt) created for BL2 by [Soze](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/af3b2d17629ab3f7f7a5f7bb68b489c5e13b0498/Borderlands%202%20mods/soze). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create one... In fact, to make the it compatible with TPS it was just necessary to add the *Laser Reload* part, the *SCAV Reload* part (which in fact is *Bandit Reload*) and few Unique weapons... so it wasn't that hard! 
All the credits go to [Soze](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/af3b2d17629ab3f7f7a5f7bb68b489c5e13b0498/Borderlands%202%20mods/soze) for the idea. 
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
