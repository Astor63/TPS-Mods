## *Cry Baby* Presto

The Assault Rifle *Cry Baby* has a bunch of special weapon effects, from E-Tech-like barrels, which fires low-velocity bullets (speed = 5.000) that oscillate up and down.

On top of that, the *Cry Baby* has 2 differents FiringModes which shot 2 types of different bullets generated by 2 Unique Barrels:

1. __*Red Bullet:*__ Killing an enemy temporarily increases damage (prefix Bloody) fired from the *Wiggle CryBaby Unique Barrel* 
2. __*Yellow Bullet:*__ Piercing enemies bullets (prefix Fletched) fired from the *Default CryBaby Unique Barrel*.

Not clear? Maybe it will be more clear in a table:

| Assault Rifle            | Bullet Type     | Bullet Speed  | 
| -------------            | -------------   | ------------- |  
| - TPS Standard AR-       |                 |               |
| Torgue                   | GyroJet         | 1000          |
| Others Manufacturers     | Standard        | 25000         |
| - TPS Unique AR-         |                 |               |
| Hail                     | Standard        | 2400          |
| __*Cry Baby - Default*__ | *Red Bullet*    | 5000          | 
| __*Cry Baby - Wiggle*__  | *Yellow Bullet* | 5000          |
| Major Tom                | Standard        | 25000         |
| Hammer Breaker           | Standard        | 25000         |
| - BL2 Standard AR-       |                 |               |
| Assault Rifle            | Standard        | 25000         |
| E-Tech - Blaster         | E-Tech          | 8000          |

So yes, even in comparaison with a *BL2 AR E-Tech - Blaster*, the red/yellow bullet speed is a bit (too) slow...

### What do this Mod?

Those which have some knowledge in Italian language already guess it, as they know that *Presto* mean *quickly/rapidly*... and more precisely *at a fast speed* in English. 

This mod adapt the *Cry Baby's red/yellow bullet speed* from 5.000 (defaut vanilla game value) to 25.000 (standard AR bullet speed) by braket of 5.000 with toggle option.

| Cry Baby                 | Bullet Speed    | Value                               | 
| -------------            | -------------   | -------------                       |  
| Normal Speed             | 5000            | Default vanilla game value          |
| 2x Faster                | 10000           | 25% Faster than a BL2 E-Tech Blaster|
| 3x Faster                | 15000           | 2x Faster than a BL2 E-Tech Blaster |
| 4x Faster                | 20000           | Something between                   |
| 5x Faster                | 25000           | Similar to standard AR bullet speed |

__Note:__ A higher projectile velocity will proportionally change the vertical oscillation, so feel free to toggle the best option that suit you
