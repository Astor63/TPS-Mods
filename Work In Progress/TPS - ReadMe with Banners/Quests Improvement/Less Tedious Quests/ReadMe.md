## Less Tedious Quests

As the title suggests it, makes a few timed and objective count __-failable!-__ optional mission less tedious to complete:

### Objective Count Missions:

Makes a few objective count __-failable!-__ optional mission less tedious, but still a little bit challenging, to complete by decreasing the objective count by 20%, 35% or 50% on the following missions

- __*Let Turrets Kill Scavs*__ (in *Titan Robot Production Plant* during *Let's Build a Robot Army* multi-stage main mission)

### Timed Missions:

Makes a few timed __-failable!-__ optional mission less tedious, but still a little bit challenging, to complete by increasing the countdown time by 50% (x1.5), 100% (x2) or Untimed on the following missions

- __*Pop Racing*__ (Triton Flats) 
- __*Recruitement Drive*__ (Triton Flats) 
- __*The Don*__ (Vorago Solitude)

__Note:__ *Pop Racing* optional mission with double time (3:00 instead of 1:30) countdown... you can even fall in lava and grab a new car during the race, you'll still have enough time eat a picnic at the roadside before passing -winner!- the finish line!

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### To do:

- [ ] Make again a new playtrought to be sure that I don't miss a timed or objective count __-failable!-__ optional mission somewhere.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ smart notes.

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Quest Fix](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Quest%20Changes/QuestFix.txt) created for BL2 by [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create one. All the credits go to [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell) for the idea.
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
