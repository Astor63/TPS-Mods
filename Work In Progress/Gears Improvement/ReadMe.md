This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## Gears Improvement:

- ### Weapons Improvement:

  - #### Assault Rifle Improvement: 

     - ***KerBoom* with Singularity Grenade:** Turns the KerBoom into a useful weapon by
shooting 1 rockets, which spawn 1 singularity child grenade.
  
  - #### Shotgun Improvement:

     - ***Wombat* No Self-Damage:** Now this Torgue shotgun becomes viable for *second wind* as you will not automatically go down again from the self-damage.
 
  - #### Sniper Rifle Improvement:

     - ***Omni-Cannon* with Grenade Damage:** with this *Grenade Damage Bonus* added, the *Omni-Cannon* will become one of the BEST sniper rifle in TPS.

- ### Items:

  - #### Grenades Improvement:

      - ***Kiss Of Death* Enhanced:** Double the grenade damages and triple the fuse time.

  - #### Shields Improvement:

     - ***Black Hole* On Steroids:** Now, the singularity effect is very useful for drawing in enemies for a second wind, and can often kill common enemies in a single blast.

     - ***Booster Shields* Auto Pick-Up:** Automatically pick-up, however, to balance the auto pick-up advantage, the restoration value is reduced from Â±20%.
 
     - ***Moxxi's Slammer* "Drink" Auto Pick-Up:** Automatically pick-up simply by walking on it.
     
     - ***SuperNova* Improved:** A lowered capacity coupled with a faster recharge makes the SuperNova really devastating when exploding (more often) in a huge and powerful Incendiary Nova blast.
     
     - ***Whiskey Tango Foxtrot* Tweak:** Double the *IED (Improvised Explosive Device) boosters* dropped to increase the *Whiskey Tango Foxtrot* offensive capability.
