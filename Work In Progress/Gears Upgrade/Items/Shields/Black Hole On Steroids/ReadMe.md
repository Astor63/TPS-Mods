## *Black Hole* On Steroids

To become competitive with the Maliwan's Legendary shield *Supernova*, the singularity ability is boosted to make better use of pulling nearby enemies towards the wearer when the shield charge is depleted, then (only) explodes in a powerful Shock Nova blast.

Now, with the boost, the singularity effect is very useful for drawing in enemies for a second wind, and can often kill common enemies in a single blast.

It can also be used to break enemy attack patterns, drag enemies out of cover and wipe them out with a combination of nova and gunfire before they recover completely from the stun effect, making it a viable offensive shield as well.

### Where to find it?

The *Black Hole* can be obtained randomly from any suitable loot source but has an increased chance to drop from *Colonel Zarpedon* in *Eye of Helios* and *The Invincible Empyrean Sentinel* in *Eleseer*. 

### Changelog:

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Gear Overhaul 1.36](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon/Gear%20Overhaul%201.36.txt) created for BL2 by [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create some gears improvements (one by one). All the credits go to [Orudeon](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Orudeon) for the idea.
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
