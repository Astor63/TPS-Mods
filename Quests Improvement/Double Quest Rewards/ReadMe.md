## Double Quest Reward

### What do this mod?

 This Mod will give you the choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with the desired element/part/accessory... and reduce the time spent doing "farming".
 
 **Note:** This *Double Quest Rewards* Mod reflect the changes already done in "Quest Change" from UCP 2.2

__Note:__ *Double Quest Rewards* give you the choice between 2 Unique Assault Rifle Vladof *Ice Scream* if you give the ice to Nina at the end of the mission *Bunch of Ice Holes*... or 2 Unique Jakobs Shotgun *Two Scoops* if you give the ice to B4R-BOT (not pictured)

### Changelog:

### Compatibility:

- *Double Quest Rewards* was tested -and work nicely!- with:
  - [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)
  - [TPS Better Loot Mod](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Apocalyptech/TPS%20Better%20Loot%20Mod) & [TPS Cold Dead Hands](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Apocalyptech/TPS%20Cold%20Dead%20Hands) from [Apocalyptech](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Apocalyptech)

:warning: To be sure to get this mod working correctly -as intended!-, don't forget to place it **AFTER** *UCP Patch*. (*Better Loot* & *Cold Dead Hands* can be placed anywhere regarding my mod). 

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### To do:

- [ ] Upgrade the *Double Quest Rewards* to weapon/item rewards for the DLC *Claptastic Voyage*.
- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the Unique weapon/item rewards are given correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Erase this to-do list.
