## Less Tedious Quest

As the title suggests it, makes a few timed and objective count __-failable!-__ optional mission less tedious to complete:

### Objective Count Missions:

- __*Let Turrets Kill Scavs*__ (during *Let's Build a Robot Army* multi-stage main mission) can be toggle from 12 to 10/8/6.

  - __*The Don*__ in Vorago Solitude - Time limit increased to 6:45 (instead of 4:30)

  - __*Pop Racing*__ in Triton Flats - Time limit increased to 3:00 (instead of 1:30)
  - __*Recruitement Drive*__ in Triton Flats - Time limit increased to 9:00 (instead of 4:30)
  - __*The Don*__ in Vorago Solitude - Time limit increased to 9:00 (instead of 4:30)

__Note:__ *Pop Racing* optional mission with double time (3:00 instead of 1:30) countdown... you can even fall in lava and grab a new car during the race, you'll still have enough time eat a picnic at the roadside before passing -winner!- the finish line!

  - Initial public release
- v1.0.1, November 12, 2018

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### To do:

- [ ] Make again a new playtrought to be sure that I don't miss a timed or objective count __-failable!-__ optional mission somewhere.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ smart notes.

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Quest Fix](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Quest%20Changes/QuestFix.txt) created for BL2 by [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create one. All the credits go to [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell) for the idea.
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
